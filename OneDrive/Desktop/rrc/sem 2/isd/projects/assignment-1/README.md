## Assignment
Assignment 1: This task will create essential classes that will be part of a larger system. These classes will implement the concepts covered in Module 01, particularly encapsulation, by using private attributes along with public accessors and mutators. The classes will also undergo extensive unit testing, including the planning of those tests. Remember, the classes developed in this assignment will be used in future tasks, so selecting meaningful identifiers and providing thorough documentation will be crucial as the project evolves throughout the semester.
